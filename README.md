Week 2 Challenge for UCD

This was a project I was really happy to work on. 
I have made my initial webpage and I am happy to continue to work on it. 

What made this project so fun was that I was able to use my own creativity in addition to the tools I learned during the bootcamp. 

I had to pull a lot of inspiration from the internet. I was able to find a ton of different resources on CSS to be able to help assist my design. 

While the design of the current project is redumentary, I plan on continually updating the website and adding better design philosophy to it. 

Thank you for reading!
